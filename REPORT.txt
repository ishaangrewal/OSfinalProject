- Describe how you keep track of open file offsets

- Explain why it's a good idea to copy the exec args in kernel space
  before performing the exec

- List 3 security exposures that your implementation of exec addressed

- Read about the opendir system call. Why do we need a dedicated system
  call for opening directories? Why not just open a directory as if it
  were a file and look at its internal representation?

- We implement the open, close, read, and write system calls. All
  Unix-like systems have corresponding higher level library
  functions: fopen, fclose, fread, and fwrite. How come?
